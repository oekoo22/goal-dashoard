# Project Overview
This project creates a dashboard where students can track their study programms and modules. With this Dashboard they can see how many ECTS they've already collected and what percentage of the total study goal they've reached. They can see which modules they currently are working on.

## Sketch
In the goal-dashboard/eval-assets folder you have the file 'Dashboard-Skizze.png' which contains a raw impression of what the dashboard should include.

## UML
In the goal-dashboard/eval-assets folder you have the file 'Dashboard-UML.png' which contains a UML Diagramm. Use this as the foundation of the implementation.

# Tech Stack
This whole project should be written in python. For the frontend the tech is not completely defined. Evaluate best-practices to implement such an dashboard with python-only - commonly disuss the use of streamlit or tkinter but don't feel limited with these suggestions, evaluate what's best.

NOTE: This project is not meant to be in a productive state, it is demo project to demonstrate the use of Object Oriented Programming in python.

# Accessibility
Please remember to always reach the max level of accessibility during the whole application.

# Usability
Use clean and minimal patterns for users to maximize usability for every user. Also include both, a light design and a dark design - create a button where the users can select their preferences.

# Color scheme
Primary: #F67280
Secondary: #C06C84
Third: #6C5B7B
Fourth: 355C7D

Make them accessible in both, light and dark mode. Don't overengineer these colors, remember to use minimal design principles.

# Structure
Evaluate if a small structure like: 
* models.py
* gui.py
* main.py
might be enough. If not, don't overcomplicate this project. Force a simple solution and a simple overall structure.
